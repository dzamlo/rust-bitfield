## [Unreleased]

## [0.19.0] - 2025-02-23

### Fixed
- Allow to specify an array of bools.

### Breaking Changes
- If the type of an array field is exactly `bool`, then the `Bit`/`BitMut` traits are used instead of
  `BitRange`/`BitRangeMut`. In some very unlikely case where the traits are implemented manually, this may break
  existing code.

## [0.18.1] - 2025-01-29

### Fixed
- Don't use `__bitfield_*` macros from the code generated by the proc-macros. Otherwise, they need to be imported by 
  the calling code.
- Allow `mask`, `from` and `ìnto` as getter names.

## [0.18.0] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- With the new proc macro implementation some corner-cases that were not handled are now handled correctly.

### Breaking Changes
- The syntax to create a constructor by specifying individual fields has been removed.
- Some syntax that was supposed to be internal and implementation details are now rejected.

## [0.13.2] - 2019-05-28

### Added
- `from into` can be used in place of `from` to change the input type of the setter. Thanks to @roblabla
