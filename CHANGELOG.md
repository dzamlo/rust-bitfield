## [Unreleased]

### Added
 - In debug mode, check that msb >= lsb in the default `BitRange`/`BitRangeMut` implementations and show a more helpful
   message than before if this is the case, thanks to @blaine-dodson for reporting
 - Mention MSB and LSB ordering in the readme
 - Explain sign extension and valid range of signed field in the readme

## [0.19.2] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- Allow usage of a signed int types for the base of newtype, thanks to @FeeeeK

## [0.19.1] - 2025-05-14

### Fixed
- Allow to use `impl new` with `#[deny(missing_docs)]`.

## [0.19.0] - 2025-02-23

### Fixed
- Allow to specify an array of bools.

### Breaking Changes
- If the type of an array field is exactly `bool`, then the `Bit`/`BitMut` traits are used instead of
  `BitRange`/`BitRangeMut`. In some very unlikely case where the traits are implemented manually, this may break
  existing code.

## [0.18.1] - 2025-01-29

### Fixed
- Don't use `__bitfield_*` macros from the code generated by the proc-macros. Otherwise, they need to be imported by 
  the calling code.
- Allow `mask`, `from` and `Ã¬nto` as getter names.

## [0.18.0] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- With the new proc macro implementation some corner-cases that were not handled are now handled correctly.

### Breaking Changes
- The syntax to create a constructor by specifying individual fields has been removed.
- Some syntax that was supposed to be internal and implementation details are now rejected.

## [0.17.0] - 2024-09-08

### Breaking Changes
- Changes published as 0.16.2 (version now yanked) was breaking

## [0.16.2] - 2024-09-07

### Added
- Allow creating bitfield structs with arbitrary visibilities, thanks to @ADSteele916

## [0.16.1] - 2024-07-25

### Added
- Implement bitwise operations for all array-Like inner types, using `AsRef`/`AsMut`, thanks to @PokeJofeJr4th
- Allow to derive constructors, thanks to @PokeJofeJr4th

## [0.16.0] - 2024-07-22

### Added
 - Easily Derive Bitwise Operations, thanks to @PokeJofeJr4th

### Breaking Changes
 - The minimum rustc version is now 1.79.0

## [0.15.0] - 2024-04-09

### Added
 - Allow to generate mask for a field

### Breaking Changes
 - The minimum rustc version is now 1.46.0

## [0.14.0] - 2022-07-11

### Added
 - Getters work with immutable Data

### Breaking Changes
 - The minimum rustc version is now 1.31.0
 - The setters of the `BitRange` and `Bit` has been separated in the `BitRangeMut` and `BitMut` traits.

## [0.13.2] - 2019-05-28

### Added
- `from into` can be used in place of `from` to change the input type of the setter. Thanks to @roblabla
